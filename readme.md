## HOW TO USE
The program is pretty self explanatory however you will need an API key from [weatherstack](https://weatherstack.com/), you will be prompted when this will need to be entered.

If you don't want to use a python terminal directly you can use the windows executable found in the releases [here](https://github.com/MontyEAG/WeatherApp/releases/tag/v1.0.0).
